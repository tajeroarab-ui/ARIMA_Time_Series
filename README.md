The ARIMA(1,1,1) model effectively captures Bitcoin’s volatility persistence.
A positive AR(1) coefficient confirms strong temporal dependence, while a negative MA(1) term suggests short-lived mean-reverting shocks.
Model diagnostics indicate well-behaved residuals, and forecast performance (RMSE ≈ 0.005) demonstrates good predictive accuracy.
Forecasts suggest a mild decline in volatility, consistent with a market stabilization period post-high turbulence.
